# De-hazing / De-smoking Algorithm 
```
This project is related to image de-hazing. Image dehazing is a computer vision and image processing technique used 
to enhance the visibility and clarity of images that have been captured in hazy conditions. 
Technology Used - Python, Numpy, OpenCV
```
# Problem: 
Image degradation due to haze, fog, or mist.

# Goal: 
Restore and improve the visibility and quality of images or videos by eliminating or mitigating the haze.

# Solution: 
Dark Channel Prior method, an effective  single image dehazing approach.
